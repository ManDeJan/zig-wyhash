# zig-wyhash

## What is this
I build this library to learn the Zig programming language.
My implementation is adapted from https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash and https://github.com/eldruin/wyhash-rs.
I have not benchmarked my implementation and do not know how it performs compared
to the C/C++ or Rust implementation, this is something that I would like to do in the future.
There are also no tests, once I figure out how to test I'll add tests.
I am currently not recommending this code for production use.
